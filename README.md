# Atv_Multidisciplinar

This repository is a school activity made by ```Vitin-19```, ```PEDROisaias``` and ```Pyetro7007``` to train our polymorphism skils. We created short guides about some school's subjects. 
In this project, we chose botany, Brazil's biomes and trigonometry. In botany, you can see a short explanation about types of plants (bryophyte, pteridophyte, gymnosperm and angiosperm),
register, edit and delete plants. In biomes, you can see a general explanation about all biomes from Brazil and a specific explanation about each one. And in trigonometry, you can see the
definition of all trigonometry concepts, you can see the main formula that is Pythagorean theorem and calculate the values based on this formula.
